# Recommender systems
## Part 1
a. DONE
b. Pearson correlation function is implemented in the `similarity_functions.py`
c. prediction function is implemented in the `recommender.py`
d. Popularity-Discounted, Significance-Weighted Pearson similarity. was implemented in the `similarity_functions.py`
- Why "Significance-Weighted Pearson similarity"? It’s useful because it down-weights blockbuster items and shrinks tiny-overlap correlations, so my user–user similarities reflect true shared taste and produce steadier recommendations.
